 * The array of vertex segments is structured as follows:
 * - It consists of 2 * ModelQuadFacing.COUNT ints.
 * - The first and every second int after that are vertex counts.
 * - The second and every second int after that are the ModelQuadFacing index that the preceding count applies to.
 * - If the vertex count is zero, the segment is not used and reading the facing index is undefined behavior.
 * - The array of vertex segments starts with some number of filled segments, followed by empty segments for the rest of the fixed size.
